DNS records: 

SOA: start of authority (SOA) record is information stored in a domain name system (DNS) zone about that zone and about other DNS records. 
The SOA record stores information about the name of the server that supplied the data for the zone; the administrator of the zone; the current version of the data file; the number of seconds a secondary name server should wait before checking for updates; the number of seconds a secondary name server should wait before retrying a failed zone transfer; the maximum number of seconds that a secondary name server can use data before it must either be refreshed or expire; and a default number of seconds for the time-to-live file on resource records.

A - specifies IP addresses corresponding to your domain and its subdomains;

MX - specifies where the emails for your domain should be delivered;

CNAME - specifies redirects from your domain's subdomains to other domains / subdomains;

TXT - these records are used to store text-based information related to your domain. One of their most common uses is for SPF data. SPF, or Sender Policy Framework, is an attempt to control forged e-mail.

NS: NS stands for ‘name server’ and this record indicates which DNS server is authoritative for that domain (which server contains the actual DNS records). A domain will often have multiple NS records which can indicate primary and backup name servers for that domain.
